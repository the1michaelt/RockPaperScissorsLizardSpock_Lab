As a developer, I want to make at least 10 commits with descriptive messages.
As a developer, I want to find a way to properly incorporate inheritance into my game.
As a developer, I want to account for and handle bad user input, ensuring that any user input is validated and reobtained if necessary.
As a developer, I want to store all of the gesture options/choices in a List (AS STRINGS). I want to find a way to utilize the list of gestures within my code (display gesture options, assign player a gesture, etc).
NOTE: Do not use a Gesture class until you have reached MVP for all user stories and been checked off by an instructor!
As a player, I want the correct player to win a given round based on the choices made by each player.  See below for game rules!
As a player, I want the game of RPSLS to be at minimum a “best of three” to decide a winner.
